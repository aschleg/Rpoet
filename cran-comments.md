## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the Maintainer email to an active and in-use email.

* The package Rpoet had been archived in early January 2019 due to my email being inactive. The email in use had unfortunately been hacked so I deleted it, but I neglected to update the Maintainer email for the Rpoet package and resubmit. This resubmission is to rectify this and update the package to the most recent version of R. Thank you and apologies for any inconvenience.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 14.04.3 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1, R-devel
* windows (on appveyor), R 3.6.1
* local Windows 10 64-bit install, R 3.6.1

## R CMD check results
